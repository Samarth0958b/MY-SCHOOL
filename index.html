Much research and training in the early years have gone into the making of  RPS. For teaching-learning process has not made us oblivious of the soft skills. Emphasis is laid on personality development, character-building, moral values and imparting of life-skills. This has kept at bay, the related problems of interpersonal relationship, degrading moral values, high level of stress, unhealthy competition and instant gratification of desires, low ethical surrender, reckless living and belief in justifying all means to attain  a noble end. It is no doubt that what RPS develops are well rounded personalities, fine tuned to meet the demands of modern life.

May lord always guide and bless us in our noble endeavor. </p>

Like a sapling that grows with careful nurturing and supervision, we have seen the birth and growth of an education system of which RPS has been the crux and it is now our endeavour to educate global citizens at R.P.S.

Moulding impressionable minds, unleashing the hidden potentials and guiding them to the right paths lit with learning and knowledge is a challenging and a very responsible job. A job that cannot be taken up without total and true dedication, determination and passion. 

The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential… these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence. Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.

At RPS, we emphasise on Excellence. Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue of excellence, but we rather have those because we acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but a habit. 

Day is not far when our young scholars of RPS  would soon excellent in every field and prove their mettle as young scientists, young sportsmen, young achievers in almost all the fields of Education. After all, we impart more than Academics …………. Education.

  			<p class="text-muted text-left" >RPS is a high-tech, futuristic, numero uno school where knowledge reigns supreme. We aim at grooming each child academically, socially and spiritually so that he/she becomes very confident and well balanced citizen of the world. We can also very proudly say that we are the pioneers in digital learning and we always upgrade technology so that we are able to provide a cutting edge technology platform for our students.

RPS has always believed that education can bring about a positive change in the society. This has led us to come up with initiatives like hope for the Future, Women Empowerment for Educational Development and Rural Education Mission. Through these initiatives we hope to leave an indelible mark on the society. We instill the values of creative thinking, confidence building and respecting others values and beliefs and developing a spirit of tolerance. The scholars are skillfully trained in Life Skill Education too. The purpose of education must extend beyond purely clinical outputs. It must contain ethical underpinning and promote values that we aspire to as a community. We must remember that intelligence with character is the ultimate goal of true education.

                Home composting is aneffective and efficient way to dramatically reduce your waste stream at home, while doing your part to reduce your carbon footprint. To educate the students about home composting and to motivate them to adopt it in their daily life, two eminent personalities of Dharuhera-Bhiwadi area, Mr. Ram Prakash and Mr. Vipin Chaudhary visited RPSD and conducted an enlightening session for our students. The workshop will be conducted on weekly basis and will continue for 8 weeks.
